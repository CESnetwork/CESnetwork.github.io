# CES-net 
Computers, Ethics and Society Research Network 

Our mission is to advance technology ethics research and strengthen ethics education. We aim to achieve this by means of a collaborative research network (CES-net) dedicated to knowledge sharing, ideation, and the development of ethics-focused educational practices. Through open collaboration, we wish to create a research community dedicated to understanding and shaping the ethics discourse in relation to technology.
## We are committed to:
- Advancing technology ethics research: Conducting interdisciplinary research to further our understanding of ethical challenges related to technology and its impact on society
- Promoting and supporting technology ethics education: Aiding educators by sharing best practices in teaching technology ethics, as well as by sharing resources and teaching materials. 
- Furthering ethics education research: We develop and share evidence-based methods and resources for embedding ethical inquiry into educational programs in higher education.
- Open and inclusive community: We foster respect, collaboration, and the active inclusion of various perspectives, from new-comers to established professionals in the field.
